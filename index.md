  - Sourced out data layout
- Research time-series forecasting method (watch video of Forecasting the Future Using Time Series by John Mount (aiplus.training)
- Review various anomaly detection via watch video of Introduction to Fraud and Anomaly detection by Dr. Aric LaBarr via aiplus.training.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Week 3 - 6/14/25

- Set up project hypothesis -
- “This project tests the hypothesis that locally fine-tuned language models, integrated with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, produce more accurate and insightful Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) narratives from transactional financial data than commercial LLM services like ChatGPT or Claude.”

- Started to compile data source using financial data from 2023, 2024 and 2025.
  Rationale for the multiple time period data is to assess whether the LLM can provide various cut of analysis between MtM(month to month), YoY (year over year), QtQ (quarter to quarter) and YTD (year to date)
- This sample data set will also be input through commercial LLM to compare
- Re-proposed project idea to Dr. Allen about using sales data from cannabis industry to integrate both time-series forecasting and anomaly detection to have a more data science approach.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Week 2 - 6/7/25

### Progress Report
- Dive deeper into ideation of creating a LLM with retrieval through research of tech requirements
- Review data options sourcing - where is it coming from, how clean is it, structure of the data
    Currently looking at excel format.
- Reviewing ETL process - what is required to clean the data, 
- Reviewed local requirement - hardware (do I have enough  specs to perform fine-tuning, hosting local LLM
- Construct project idea into one sentence projection submission

<!--### Difficulties of the Week

### Goals for Next Week
- Submit project idea via Canvas
- Review environment setup and construct hypothesis

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Week 1 - 5/31/25
